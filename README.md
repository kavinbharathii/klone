### Klone
A github repo cloning cli tool written in rust.

### Installation:
```
$git clone https://github.com/kavinbharathii/klone
```
and build the project if you have `cargo` or `rustc` installed. Alternatively, you can download the, klone.exe file available in `release`.

### Usage:
Add the path to `klone.exe` to `PATH`. After that, 

```
$klone { github username } { repo name }
```
 
This will create a `{repo_name}_clone` folder in the working directory. If you want to name the folder,
```
$klone { github username } { repo name } { dirname }
```
